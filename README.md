# Config Package

The Config package provides a simple and efficient way to access configuration parameters stored in PHP files within the config directory of your application.

## Requirements

* PHP 8.2 or later

## Installation via Composer

Add `"omegacms/config": "^1.0.0"` to the require block in your `composer.json` file and then run `composer install`.

```json
{
    "require": {
        "omegacms/config": "^1.0.0"
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you can simply run the folowing from the command line:

```sh
composer require omegacms/config "^1.0.0"
```

If you want to include the test sources, use:

```sh
composer require --prefer-source omegacms/config "^1.0.0"
```
